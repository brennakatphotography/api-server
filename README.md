# Photo API

This is an API for managing photos for a personal portfolio site. This is my first personal project since graduating school. It is an app for my wife so she can upload, share, and eventually sell her photography.

## Install Java and Leiningen

* Install Java 1.8 if not already installed.
* Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).
* Environment variables should go into `./.lein-env` as a Clojure hash-map literal. See `.example.lein-env`.

## Running the API

```bash
$ lein run
```
